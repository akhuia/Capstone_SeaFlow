# Capstone_SeaFlow
Data	Science Application	in Marine	Biology to examine the  [SeaFlow Data](http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/resources/seaflow)

###Introduction
This project is being going on at UW Seattle. The current work on this project is being done as a Capstone project primarily by Abhigyan Kaustubh, Elton Dias, and Tanmay Modak - who will be the prime contributors of this repo for the period of this capstone project. 
The aforementioned current work involves analyzing the SeaFlow Data to explore and have a greater comprehension of Marine Biology using various Machine Learning Algorithms.

###Project Background

Oceanographers	use	flow	cytometry	to	measure	the	optical	properties	of	a	given	sample	of	water	through	radial	dispersion.	This	is	done	by	attaching	flow	cytometers	to	the	bottom	of	ships	that	conduct	research,	thus	enabling	coverage	of	a	vast	body	of	water.	

We	plan	to	collect	flow	cytometry	data	obtained	at	3	minute	time	intervals	(might	change),	and	use	a	suitable	clustering	technique	to	identify	regions	in the	water	body	that	have	similar	trends	in	microscopic	life	form	population.	

###Objectives

1. To	map	the	different	regions	of	a	water	body	based	on	the	variation	in	the	population	of	different	life	forms	in	these	regions.
2. To	identify	regions	within	the	water	body	that	are	similar/different	to other	regions	based	on	the	forward	scatter	data	obtained	using	the	SeaFlow	instrument.	
3. To	draw	meaningful	inferences	about	the	variation	of	the	population	of	these	life	forms	(and	possibly	correlate	these	inferences	with	environmental	factors	like	temperature,	salinity,	etc.).
4. To	successfully	implement	our	algorithm	in	relevant	environments	(initially	in	Python,	and	potentially	Myria	and/or	other	large-scale	systems)
