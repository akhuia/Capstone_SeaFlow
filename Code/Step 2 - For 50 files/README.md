Purpose of the code:

1. Given: 2 sets of 25 files: “open ocean”, “coastal”.
2. Calculate mean and the variance of each file
3. Explore and plot - best ways to visualize
4. Plot based on eigenvectors for all 50 files - should be 3 plots, each containing stuff from all the 50 files
5. Scatter plot for all 25 files (each set) - should visually look different to humans.
        a. X axis: Forward scatter, Y axis: chlorophyll 
6. Run PCA on all 50 files to create 50 x 2 array
7. Play with k-means
