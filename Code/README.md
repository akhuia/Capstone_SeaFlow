###Code

####This directory consists of all the code that is developed as part of this Capstone project.

This is done in the following steps:

   [Step 1 - For 1 sample file](https://github.com/akhuia/Capstone_SeaFlow/tree/master/Code/Step%201%20-%20%20For%201%20sample%20file): 
      Run PCA on the initial trial file with one sample-data file.
   
   [Step 2 - For 50 files](https://github.com/akhuia/Capstone_SeaFlow/tree/master/Code/Step%202%20-%20For%2050%20files): Run PCA on the 50 data files - which are the same in structure as the initial trial one.
